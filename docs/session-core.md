# Session Core

This document briefly explains the session core introduced for [issue 1](https://github.com/juancopi81/gitair/issues/1), the manually steerable dry run added for [issue 2](https://github.com/juancopi81/gitair/issues/2), and the strict invalid-operation guards added for [issue 3](https://github.com/juancopi81/gitair/issues/3).

The goal of this first slice is not to build real audio, webcam input, live visuals, or a real music model integration yet. The goal is to make the first Gitair core path explicit enough that I can explain it from memory before delegating broader work to agents.

## Layout

This first slice introduces the initial project layout:

- `gitair/`: the main Python package.
- `gitair/core/`: the core session logic and data models.
- `gitair/companions/`: companion implementations. For now, this only includes a fake companion.
- `gitair/demos/`: small executable demos that assemble the components together.
- `tests/`: focused tests for the current Gitair behavior.

The layout is intentionally small. More folders should only be added when the project earns them through working demos.

## Session

A `Session` is the core object of this first Gitair slice.

Right now, it is very simple and follows this workflow:

1. A `Session` starts in `PRIMING_PASS` by default.
2. During the priming pass, the guitarist plays first.
3. At some point, the session receives a `PhraseContext`.
4. The `PhraseContext` represents musical context from the priming pass, such as chords, tempo, style, and prompt summary.
5. Once the session has phrase context, it can receive a `ControlAction`.
6. Right now, the only supported control action is `START_JAM_PASS`.
7. `START_JAM_PASS` moves the session from `PRIMING_PASS` to `JAM_PASS`.
8. A companion receives a `SessionSnapshot` and responds from it.

In short:

```text
Session starts
  → PRIMING_PASS
  → receives PhraseContext
  → receives START_JAM_PASS
  → moves to JAM_PASS
  → FakeCompanion responds from SessionSnapshot
```

For Milestone 1, invalid session operations fail with explicit errors instead of silently doing nothing. This keeps the core strict while the input surfaces are still manual and easy to inspect.

Current invalid operations include:

- starting the jam pass without phrase context
- starting the jam pass again after the session is already in `JAM_PASS`
- asking the companion to respond before `JAM_PASS`
- asking the companion to respond without phrase context

## Core concepts

### `PhraseContext`

`PhraseContext` represents what Gitair currently knows about the phrase.

For now, it is hard-coded in the dry run, but later it may come from:

- manual input
- chord recognition
- phrase priming
- audio analysis
- embedding models
- prompt generation

Current fields include:

- chords
- tempo
- style description
- prompt summary

### `ControlAction`

`ControlAction` represents an instruction applied to the session.

For now, the only action is:

```text
START_JAM_PASS
```

Later, this vocabulary may grow to include actions such as:

- stop jam
- companion on/off
- increase intensity
- decrease intensity
- capture phrase
- reset session

### `SessionSnapshot`

`SessionSnapshot` is a serializable view of the current session state.

It currently includes:

- the current session phase
- the current phrase context, if one has been received

The snapshot is what other parts of the system can read without directly controlling the session.

### `FakeCompanion`

`FakeCompanion` proves the companion boundary.

It does not generate audio and does not talk to a real music model. It simply receives a `SessionSnapshot` and returns a fake response based on the current phase and phrase context.

This makes the future integration point clearer:

```text
FakeCompanion today
MRT2Companion later
Other companions later
```

## Dry run

The dry run demonstrates the first executable Gitair core path without real audio, webcam input, visuals, or a specific music model.

The manually steerable dry run should show:

1. the initial session snapshot
2. a phrase context being received
3. a control action starting the jam pass
4. the updated session snapshot
5. a fake companion response

This proves the first tracer bullet:

```text
Priming Pass → Phrase Context → Control Action → Jam Pass → Companion Response
```

Run it with your own phrase context:

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m gitair.demos.dry_run_session --chords "Dm7,G7,Cmaj7" --tempo-bpm 96 --style-description "quiet bossa nova" --prompt-summary "soft syncopated guitar phrase"
```

The command waits for Enter before it applies `START_JAM_PASS`. For non-interactive checks, add `--auto-start-jam`.

## What this slice intentionally does not include

This first slice does not include:

- real guitar audio
- webcam input
- gesture detection
- live visuals
- MRT2 integration
- chord recognition
- phrase analysis
- browser UI
- module loading

Those belong to later milestones.

For now, the important thing is that the core session model is small, understandable, and executable.

## Why this matters

This slice establishes the first shared vocabulary for Gitair:

- `Session`
- `PhraseContext`
- `ControlAction`
- `SessionSnapshot`
- `Companion`
- `PRIMING_PASS`
- `JAM_PASS`

Before adding agents, models, gestures, visuals, or real audio, I want to understand this core flow clearly.

The first goal is not technical completeness.

The first goal is ownership of the main abstraction.
